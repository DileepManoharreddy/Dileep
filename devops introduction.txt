if i need to create a software application,then i approch a company like wipro and ask them to create a carwala sa for me and they charge me for that project t
they said me that cost and time 
if suoppose they said to be it will be 20$ and 6 months they take to complete the work
first the create a application and build one by one module if they take 4 weeks for each module (4weeks =sprint)
by this at end of the first month we geting a first functionality we can use it,  they start to a another functionality.
but if there is any issue raised by the testers, the devloper want to fix it by the scratch
the total work will be stop in these we use devops to create a software applications in simple time
   
-- the developers write a code and update in GIT repositery and next
--build(maven tool) the setupfiles
--setupfiles was tested by the tester
           but for a change
  by using jenkins automately triggere the build process and deploye general done by (middleware engi)the testing process is completed the time efficency will be decrease
